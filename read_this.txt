Hi Carlos!

This is our shared git repository. 

In order to get my changes to your local folder: either do
1) git pull origin main
or
2.1) git fetch origin main
then you can review changes i have made before doing
2.2) git merge origin main 

in order to commit your own changes to the main branch you will do:
(3.1) git add <your file>
(if you want to add all files: write git add .)
(3.2) git commit -m "your message here - describe what you did"
(3.3) git push origin main
